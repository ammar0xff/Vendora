"""One-shot remediation for the Vercel/Neon Vendora database.

Brings a database that lived through the pre-refactor era (and accumulated e2e
test pollution) to the current production state:

  1. pg_dump backup to ./backups/ (always, before any change)
  2. All tracked migrations from scripts/migrate.py (v0-v28, idempotent)
  3. e2e pollution cleanup (by name pattern, FK-safe order)
  4. Restore the real store name
  5. Post-remediation verification report

Usage:
    python scripts/remediate_remote.py "postgresql://...sslmode=require" [--apply]

Without --apply it is a DRY RUN: shows exactly what would be deleted and what
migrations are missing, changes nothing.
